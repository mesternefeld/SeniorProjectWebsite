The Tioga Tae Kwon Do (TTKD) Training app is an application to make training
at home more feasible than just using paper and a friend. Currently, students are given
a piece of paper with the steps to perform a technique. Although the directions are
clearly marked out, most students have their parents help interpret the directions. This
would cause some confusion since a parent may read the instructions but not truly
understand what they are saying, so there is a disconnect from the parents verbal
instructions to the students practicing their technique.

This problem is what drove the TTKD training app solution. This solution provides
a way for students to record themselves and review against an instructor's videos. The
students are also able to play back any videos to gain more insight and reinforcement of
the techniques. The goal of this app is to eliminate any questions on what the written
instructions would be, and provide a way for students to more accurately practice any
techniques that were learned in class. The application films the student and places the
video next to the instructor's video so the student can look at them side by side. and see
exactly what they did wrong.
